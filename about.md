Some things in programming I wanted to have in one place, but in such a place that others can benefit from it as well. That was the main reason why I started writing this blog ... the goal is to help myself and others.

I will talk about things I learned during my career as a programmer (and which I think can be helpful to others), but I will also use various websites (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow.com</a>, <a href="https://w3schools.com/">w3schools.com</a>, blogs ...) and will write about interesting topics from those pages, trying to simplify the answers as much as possible, so that even beginners in programming understand them.

Happy coding!
